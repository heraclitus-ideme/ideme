# ideme: A Decentralized Identity Ecosystem

# Project Overview

**ideme** is a decentralized identity system that reevaluates traditional concepts of identity. It recognizes the complexity of identities in a digital and interconnected era, emphasizing the legitimacy of multiple identities per entity.

## Philosophy

The system embraces the legitimacy of Sybil identities, reflecting the diversity of identities across humans, AIs, and emergent memetic entities. It supports the view that each identity can function differently based on context, akin to various personas exhibited by an individual in different life aspects.

## Design Goals

1. **Identity Creation**: Securely establish and manage identities using public/private key pairs. Each identity maintains independence within the network.

2. **Trust Assignment**: Allow identities to assign 'trust' to each other, with transactions recorded on a blockchain for transparency and immutability.

3. **Reputation Calculation**: Separate from trust, reputation is calculated based on contextual evaluations that vary per observer, facilitating a dynamic reputation system.

4. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Use zero-knowledge proofs to enhance privacy by enabling identities to prove attributes or relationships without revealing underlying data, crucial for maintaining integrity in identity forks and inherited trust.

## Trust and Reputation

- **Objective Trust**: Trust is a quantifiable and immutable metric assigned directly by one identity to another. This objective measure is stored securely on the blockchain, providing a transparent and permanent record of trust relationships.
- **Subjective Reputation**: Reputation is a dynamic and subjective interpretation of trust records, calculated using algorithms that can adapt to the context and preferences of the observer. This allows for a flexible perception of an identity's reliability and trustworthiness based on the specific needs and viewpoints of interacting parties.

# ideme: A Decentralized Identity Ecosystem

ideme is a decentralized identity system that reinterprets the nature of identities, bridging the gap between human and AI entities. It focuses on the fluidity and multiplicity of identities, supported by a cryptographic framework and a reputational model. ideme is designed for a future where AI and human interactions are seamlessly integrated, fostering secure and dynamic identity management.

## Core Features of ideme

- **Decentralized, Self-Sovereign Identity Approach**: Moving beyond traditional individual-centric identity models to a decentralized ecosystem.
- **Fluid and Contextual Identities**: Emphasizing the dynamic nature of identities that vary with context, suitable for both humans and AI entities.
- **Cryptographic Framework for Trust and Verification**: Utilizing public key cryptography to establish a secure and trustworthy identity management system.
- **Minimal Viable Product with Basic Identity Framework**: Beginning with an MVP that introduces a basic, adaptable identity framework for AI tools/agents.
- **Decentralized Reputation System**: Incorporating a system to quantify trust and facilitate context-sensitive interactions between identities.
- **Acceptance and Utilization of Multiple Sybil Identities**: Recognizing the inevitability and potential benefits of multiple identities per individual or agent.
- **Concept of Forkable Identities**: Introducing the ability to evolve identities in response to changes in values, beliefs, or affiliations.
